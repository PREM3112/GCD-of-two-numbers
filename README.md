# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. import math function.
2. define the function.
3.Get the two numbers from the user. 
4. use math.gcd function.
5. print the value
6. run the program.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the gcd of two number using function.
Developed by:PREM.R 
RegisterNumber:23002486  
*/
import math
def gcd():
    a= int(input())
    b= int(input())
    gcd= math.gcd(a,b)
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",gcd)
```

## Output:
![gcd of two number](gcd.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
